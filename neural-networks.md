##### CH 1: Using neural nets to recognize handwritten digits

###### Perceptrons

perceptron: takes several binary inputs and produces a single binary output

weights: numbers expressing the importance of the respective inputs to the output

threshold: determines neuron's output based on whether the weighted sum is less than or greater than it; output is 0 if weighed sum is less than threshold, 1 if weighed sum is greater than threshold 

###### Sigmoid neurons

###### The architecture of neural networks

###### A simple network to classify handwritten digits

###### Learning with gradient descent

###### Implementing our network to classify digits

###### Toward deep learning
