###### Linear Algebra

- language to describe space and the manipulation of space



##### 1. Vectors, what even are they?

###### Vectors

- geometrically, can be thought of as an arrow in a coordinate system where the head sits at the point indicated by the vector & the tail sits at the origin 

###### Vector Addition

- can be thought of as combining movements (in space) 
- numerically, it is determined by adding the respective components 

###### Scalar Multiplication

- can be thought of a 'scaling' (stretching or squishing) operation
- numerically, it is determined by multiplying every component with the scalar

##### 2. Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors

###### Basis Vectors

- if each coordinate/component is a vector can be thought of as a scalar multiplied by unit vectort (in that direction), then the vector itself can be thought of as their sum
- these unit vectors are called 'basis vectors' 
- represented as i-hat & j-hat

###### Linear Combination

- operation of scaling vectors and adding them

###### Span

- set of all linear combinations

#### Matrices

#### Bases
