##### Vectors

- geometrically, can be thought of as an arrow in a coordinate system where the head sits at the point indicated by the vector & the tail sits at the origin 

###### Vector Addition

- can be thought of as combining movements (in space) 
- numerically, it is determined by adding the respective components 

###### Scalar Multiplication

- can be thought of a 'scaling' (stretching or squishing) operation
- numerically, it is determined by multiplying every component with the scalar

###### Linear Combination

###### Span

###### Basis Vectors

##### Matrices

##### Bases
