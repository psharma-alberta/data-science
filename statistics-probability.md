###### [Variance (of a population)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/variance-standard-deviation-population/v/variance-of-a-population)

- denoted by sigma squared
- (sum of squares of difference between actual & mean)/total count 
- measure of how far the data points in a population are from the population mean

###### [Standard deviation (of a population)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/variance-standard-deviation-population/v/population-standard-deviation)

- denoted by sigma 
- sq root of population variance
- measure of spread of a data distribution
- more spread -> high standard deviation, data points close to the mean -> standard deviation close to 0

###### [Variation (of a sample)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/variance-standard-deviation-sample/v/sample-variance)

- denoted by s squared
- (sum of squares of difference between actual & mean)/(total count - 1)


###### [Correlation coefficients](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data/scatterplots-and-correlation/a/correlation-coefficient-review)

- measure of strength (& direction) of a linear relationship
- +1 for a strong positive relationship, -1 for strong negative relationships, 0 for no correlation

###### [Residual](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data/regression-library/a/introduction-to-residuals)

- vertical distance between the best-fit line and a data point
- actual value - predicted value
