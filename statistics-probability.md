#### Summarizing quantitative data

###### [Variance (of a population)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/variance-standard-deviation-population/v/variance-of-a-population)

- denoted by sigma squared
- calculated as `(sum of squares of (actual - mean))/total count` 
- measure of how far the data points in a population are from the population mean

###### [Standard deviation (of a population)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/variance-standard-deviation-population/v/population-standard-deviation)

- denoted by sigma 
- calculated as `sq root of population variance`
- measure of spread of a data distribution
- more spread -> high standard deviation, data points close to the mean -> standard deviation close to 0

###### [Variation (of a sample)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/variance-standard-deviation-sample/v/sample-variance)

- denoted by s squared
- calculated as `(sum of squares of (actual - mean))/(total count - 1)`

#### Modeling data distributions

###### [Z-score](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data/z-scores/a/z-scores-review)

- measure of how many standard deviations above or below the mean a data point is
- denoted by z
- calculated from `(actual - mean)/standard deviation`  

###### [Density Curve](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data/density-curve/v/density-curves)

- used for visualizing distributions
- total area under the curve is 1
- area under the curve for any interval tells you the percentage of data that falls in that interval

###### [Normal Distribution](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data/normal-distribution-calculation/a/basic-normal-calculations)

- 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean
- 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean
- 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean

#### Exploring bivariate numerical data

###### [Describing scatterplots (form, direction, strength, outliers)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data/introduction-to-scatterplots/a/describing-scatterplots-form-direction-strength-outliers)

- Form: Is the association linear or nonlinear?
- Direction: Is the association positive or negative?
- Strength: Does the association appear to be strong, moderately strong, or weak?
- Outliers: Do there appear to be any data points that are unusually far away from the general pattern?

###### [Correlation coefficients](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data/scatterplots-and-correlation/a/correlation-coefficient-review)

- measure of strength (& direction) of a linear relationship
- denoted by r
- calculated from `1/(n-1) * sum of ( product of the z-scores of each pair of x & y values )`
- +1 for a strong positive relationship, -1 for strong negative relationships, 0 for no correlation

###### [Residual](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data/regression-library/a/introduction-to-residuals)

- vertical distance between the best-fit line and a data point
- calculated as `actual value - predicted value`

###### [Residual Plot](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data/assessing-the-fit-in-least-squares-regression/v/residual-plots)

- plots residual vs x-values
- gives a sense of how good the fit is, & whether a line explains the relationship well

###### [R-squared intuition (coefficient of determination)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data/assessing-the-fit-in-least-squares-regression/a/r-squared-intuition)

- measure of prediction error eliminated (using least-squares regression vs. just averaging)
- denoted by r squared, calculated by squaring the correlation coefficient
- equals (surprisingly) `(error from averaging - error from least-squares regression) / (error from averaging)` 

###### [Standard deviation of residuals or Root-mean-square error (RMSD)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data/assessing-the-fit-in-least-squares-regression/v/standard-deviation-of-residuals-or-root-mean-square-error-rmsd)

- same as standard deviation but uses predicted values instead of mean
- calculated as `square root of ( (sum of squares of actual - predicted) / total-1)`
